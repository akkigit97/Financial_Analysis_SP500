#things noticed from the data
1. (data wrangling) There are values missing for certain dates - weekends, holidays (easter, christmas etc)
The solution for this is to insert the missing dates with values from the previous open market date.
For example, the value on Saturday and Sunday is going to be the value at close on Friday.

2. Gaps in Opening Prices: Significant news may lead to a "gap" in the index, where it opens at a price significantly higher or lower than the previous close.

3. Key dates in US history and global- elections, covid closure, civil unrest, other big news and how it affected the index.
This is known as technical analysis in finance.

4. Look for when the top 10 company was replaced in the index.

5. Show the fluctuations in candlestick charts. Mark bull and bear zones. Implusive move and pull back.
Uptrend and downtrend - 
Uptrend:if the trend is upwards and there are fluctuations, there may be a local minimum, this is called the pullback. 
As long as the local pull back after a spike up is still higher than its previous pullback, the market is still in uptrend.
See youtube video in reference for more info.
